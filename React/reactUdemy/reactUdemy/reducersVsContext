Context and Reducer are two different concepts in React that are often used together for state management. Here's an overview of their differences:

1. Context:
Context API is a built-in mechanism in React that allows you to share global data (state) and pass it down to components in the app's component 
tree without using prop-drilling (passing props down manually through each intermediate component). It primarily consists of the 
`React.createContext` function, which creates a new context object with a `Provider` and a `Consumer` (or the `useContext` hook) for
 accessing the data within.

2. Reducer:
A reducer is a pure function often used with Redux (or with the `useReducer` hook) for managing state. It takes the current state and
 an action object as arguments, and then returns a new state based on the action. Reducers enforce a consistent and predictable manner of 
 handling state changes in a Redux store or the `useReducer` hook.
