### React Folder Structure

1. The entry point for every react application is **index.js**
2. index.html is inside public folder.
3. npm build generate a optimized built code for us which can be used for users , a new build folder is created having the optimized files and code.
4. Components in react are simply functions which returns HTML. 


1. Hooks are only in React.
2. Function components are written in **jsx** . 
3. **JSX is simply syntax extension of javascript**


this is class components , this also works the same , basically it works for rendering.

There are two ways to write React :

1. **Functional Component** : Using Jsx returns what we want to render.
2. **Class Components** : To use class components , **import { Component } from ‘react’ ;**
    
    And the code is modified as followed , the class component has a render() method
    
    ```jsx
    class App extends Component{
    	render(){
    	return (
        <div> Hello </div>
    );
    }
    ```
    
    }
