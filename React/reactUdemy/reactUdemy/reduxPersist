Redux Persist is a library that allows you to save the Redux store in the local storage of your browser or any other storage provider in web or 
React Native. When the page is refreshed, it rehydrates the state of your app to the most recent state saved in local storage.

In simple terms, Redux Persist makes the state of your app persist over page reloads or app restarts. This is especially useful if you want to 
maintain user interface state, like navigation stacks or even data cached, across sessions, without needing to save and load it from a server every time.
