Best practice is to make separate files for each component and importing them wherever we want to use them.

Maintain a folder structure, add a src folder where all the React code is kept

Move App.js file to src folder and create separate components.

In src , create componenets folder.

Create separate files like Header.js , Body.js , RestaurantCard.js 

NOTE:*** some people also use extension .jsx for component files.Both are fine & good.

We need to export the component to use it another component

```jsx
export default Header;
```

And then import the component wherever wants to use it.

```jsx
import Header from './components/Header';
```

Now both are fine , both will work 

```jsx
import Header from './components/Header.js';
```

Not necessary to write the extension, React will automaticaly treat it as JS file.

Now , thta hardcoded data should be kept separately not in component file,

Create a folder called utils inside src and make a file constants.js and add all URL using in src images .

Also create a mockData.js file add the swiggyArray.

Export them and import wherever you want to use.

Now the folder structure will look like :

üí° There are two types of exports and two type of imports.

üí° 1. Default Export and default import ‚Äî which we are using currently.

but what is I am writing like this .

This will throw error , we cannot have two export statements.This is so because by default we can only export one [thing.Here](http://thing.Here) comes another type of export i.e. **Named export.**

Named Import :

No curly braces.

NOTE:***we can export multiple things from the same file using **named export.**

Always a good practice to keep components small and clean . You can achieve it by structuring different components and export and import them.

## React Hooks

We ll make our app dynamic now.

### Feature 1 : Add a button to get top rated restaurants

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9b76015-2c25-4ae4-b3a6-af53d187876a/6348fa60-b648-4913-a0f9-b1a905fc8cbd/Untitled.png)

We get the updated list in console with rating > 4 but in UI , its not updated automatically.

Now we ll make a state variable for the component.

For this , we ll use React hook - **useState**

React hooks are normal JS utility functions written by Facebook developers. To use them, we ll have to import them.

Two important hooks :
1. useState() -  this can be imported from ‚Äúreact‚Äù and can be imported as Names import.

```jsx
import {useState} from 'react';
```

1. useEffect () - 

### useState:

It maintains the state of your component.

useState can be imported from ‚Äòreact‚Äô as named import.

define local state variable in an array as obj and a set function(to update the varibale obj , always use set -industry norm) and assign it to useState() hook.

The useState hook will always have a default value of obj.

In button - on click , we ll filter top restauarants and pass that updated list in set function ‚Äî setListRestaurant(filteredList)- this is how it will update the UI.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9b76015-2c25-4ae4-b3a6-af53d187876a/3b7aa12e-8502-4c9b-8754-2d9c074fba2a/Untitled.png)

We can always modify the list or any data object using set function , it can‚Äôt be done directly in React.

Now if we want to make the list i.e. obj here empty then ‚Äî setListRestaurant([]) is correct.

whatever value we are sending in set function sets the value of the obj.

NOTE:***** Whenever a state variable updates , REACT re-renders the component.

REACT is best at re-rendering. React is good at DOM manipulation.

### How this re-rendering is done in REACT Or How React works behind the scenes ?

1. React uses **reconciliation algorithm , this also is also known as React Fiber**
2. We ll explain this with filtering top restaurants.
3. The initial all restaurants being displayed in UI, on click of button to filter ,React will create a virtual DOM.
4. **Virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM. It is basically object consists of all react elements** which are then converted into actual HTML elements in actual DOM.
5. What is a **diff algorithm ?**
    
    It find the difference between the previous virtual DOM and updated virtual DOM. As user click on button to filter , the updated virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM will be compared , calculate the difference and then update the difference in the actual DOM , which is basically re-rendering in React.
    
6. In 2016, this new algorithm came out to update the DOM - Reconciliation.
7. **React is therefore fast because it not compare the actual DOM or HTML elements but it compares Virtual DOMS which is nothing but objects , comparing objects is easier and then it re-renders the difference in actual DOM.**

### Interview question - How React is faster ?

### Ans: React performs efficient DOM Manipulation - how - with React reconciliation - explain the whole virtual DOM concept.

React tracks local state varibles. Here , setListREstaurant function performs React reconciliation.

üí° const [obj , setFunction] = useState([]); ‚Äî useState returns an array. This is array destructuring.
