Js engine is the heart of JS runtime environment browser and Node js both have JS runtime and environment

node js can run JS code outside the browser

V8 in chrome as well as Node js

first Js engine - spiderMonkey used in Mozilla firefox

JS engines itself is piece of code

JS engine architecture

input JS code ---> parsing (code is broken down into tokens) --> AST abstract syntax tree ---> compilation ---> execution

Compilation - whole code is compiled first and then executed after compilation , a optimized version of code is generated and then executed
Interpretion - executing code line by line

JS can behave as interpreetd as well as compiled language depending upon JS engine

Most browser uses both interpreter and compiler

JS is just in time compiltion - uses both interpretion and compiler
