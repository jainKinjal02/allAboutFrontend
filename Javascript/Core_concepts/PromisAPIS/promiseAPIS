When we want to make multiple API calls parallelly then we need these Promise APIs.

## Promise.all()
takes array of promises, returns a single promise which is resolved if all the promises are resolved.
Promise.all([p1,p2,p3]) , three parallel API calls
returns an array of results of all resolved promises.
In Promise.all() if any of the promises fail, it will return error immediately.

Promise.allSettled()
It will always give output with results of resolved promises and errors of rejected promises. Unlike promise.all() which quickly
cancels if any of the one fails

## Promise.race()
as the name suggests, one who finishes will give the results.Hence , we ll always get a single value rather than an array of results.
if any of the promise fails like after 2 seconds , p3 fails , it will return the (error)
Basically , it returns the result of first settled promise  - it can be rejected or resolved.

### Promise.any() â€” success seeking race
wait for first fullfill - success
what if all the three fails,
returns aggregate error , array of all the three errors.
