In JavaScript, load balancers are mechanisms that distribute network traffic or computational workloads across multiple resources to optimize performance, prevent server overload, and ensure high availability. They're typically used in:

Server-side JavaScript (Node.js)

Distribute incoming HTTP requests across multiple server instances
Improve application scalability and fault tolerance
Prevent any single server from being overwhelmed


Client-side JavaScript

Manage concurrent API requests
Control asynchronous task execution
Optimize resource utilization in web applications



Common load balancing strategies include:

Round-robin: Rotating requests sequentially
Least connections: Sending requests to server with fewest active connections
Weighted distribution: Allocating tasks based on server capacity

While JavaScript doesn't have built-in load balancing, developers use libraries like:

cluster module in Node.js
pm2 process manager
Third-party load balancing libraries

Implementing a basic load balancer involves creating a distribution mechanism that routes requests or tasks efficiently across available resources.
